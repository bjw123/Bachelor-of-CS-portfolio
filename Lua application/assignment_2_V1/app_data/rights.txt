COMMUNITY RIGHTS

The WA Police Charter of Rights outlines a series of rights and obligations that apply to the community. 

This charter, although not a piece of legislation, refers to the cooperation and compliance shown by the community towards Western Australian police. 

Rather, this Charter of Rights sets out moral conventions to be respected and upheld by members of the community.
